####First Program discussion
First program is designed to start counting from 8 until it hits a non-negative number, where it will stop.
It adds hex a to the accumulator, adds one, and will loop while the accumulator is negative in signed 4 bit.
When it reaches 0, it becomes non-negative, so the loop ends.
